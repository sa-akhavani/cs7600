	OVERVIEW of CHECKPOINT-RESTART

This document provides an overview of the homework.  Some of the details
in this overview are clarified in 000-README, and in some cases, by
small example programs that illustrate a systems technique.
Therefore, the recommended reading order is:

Recommended reading order:
  I.   OVERVIEW - conceptual overview
  II.  000-README - step-by-step description of what to implement and how
  III. BACKGROUND - example programs that illustrate the systems techniques used
However, if something is unclear, feel free to stop in the middle
(for example, in the middle of OVERVIEW), and read an appropriate
section for details (e.g., in 000-README.)
